pyramid_formish
==================

:mod:`pyramid_formish` is a package which provides :mod:`pyramid` bindings
for the :term:`Formish` package, which is an excellent form generation and
validation package for Python.

This package provides:

- A ``chameleon.zpt`` Formish "renderer" class.

- A set of ``chameleon.zpt`` templates which implement the default
  Formish widgetset.

- A convenience ``Form`` implementation, which inherits from the
  standard ``formish.Form`` class, but uses the ``chameleon_zpt``
  renderer instead of the default Formish ``mako`` renderer.

- A ``formish:add_template_path`` ZCML directive which allows for the
  configuration of override Formish template locations.

- A ``formish:form`` ZCML directive which can be used to configure a
  :mod:`pyramid_formish` "form controller".

- A ``formish:forms`` ZCML directive which can be used to configure a
  collection of :mod:`pyramid_formish` "form controllers" to be
  able to render them in the same HTML page.

This package requires Python>=2.6<=2.7X.  It also requires Chameleon>=1.999
(it will not run under Chameleon 2.X).

ZCML Directives
---------------

``pyramid_formish`` uses ZCML to do its configuration.

You must add the following to your application's ``configure.zcml`` to
use the ``formish:form`` and ``formish:forms`` ZCML directives:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <include package="pyramid_formish" file="meta.zcml"/>

You must also change your ZCML file's ``configure`` element to define
the ``formish`` namespace:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

    <configure xmlns="http://pylonshq.com/pyramid"
               xmlns:formish="http://pylonshq.com/pyramid_formish">
    ....
    </configure>

.. note:: If you see a traceback mentioning "unbound prefix" at
   startup time, it's because you forgot to add the ``xmlns:formish``
   attribute to your ZCML's ``configure`` tag.

``formish:form`` ZCML Directive
-------------------------------

When the ``meta.zcml`` of :mod:`pyramid_formish` is included within your
:mod:`pyramid` application, you can make use of the ``formish:form`` ZCML
directive.  A ``formish:form`` configures one or more special
:mod:`pyramid` "view" callables that render a form, making use of a
user-defined "form controller".

The ZCML directive requires Python code in the form of a *form
controller*.

You refer to the form controller within a ``formish:form`` ZCML
directive using the ``controller`` attribute, which is a dotted Python
name referring to the form controller class:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <formish:form
     for=".models.MyModel"
     name="add_community.html"
     renderer="templates/form_template.pt"
     controller=".forms.AddCommunityController"
     form_id="theform"/>

The above example assumes that there is a ``forms`` module which lives
in the same directory as the ``configure.zcml`` of your application,
and that it contains a form controller class named
``AddCommunityCommunityController``.  The ``controller`` attribute
names a *controller* for this form definition.  

The ``for``, ``name``, and ``renderer`` attributes of a
``formish:form`` tag mirror the meaning of the meanings of these names
in :mod:`pyramid` ``view`` ZCML directive.

``for`` represents the class or interface which the context must
implement for this view to be invoked. It is optional.  If it is not
supplied, the form will be invokable against any context.

``name`` is the view name.  It is optional.  If it is not supplied, it
defaults to the empty string ``''``, which implies that the form will
be the default view for its context.

``renderer`` is the path to a Chameleon ZPT template which will be used to
render the form when it is first presented, or redisplay the form with errors
when form validation fails.  The template is either a :mod:`pyramid`
"resource specification" or an absolute or ZCML-package-relative path to an
on-disk template.  It is optional.  If it is not supplied, the ``__call__``
method of the form controller must return a :class:`webob.Response` object
rather than a dictionary.

The ``form_id`` tag represents the HTML ``id`` attribute value that
the form will use when rendered.

``method`` indicates the form submission method (the ``method``
attribute of the HTML tag representing the form).  It must be one of
``GET`` or ``POST``.  It is optional.  If it is not provided, ``POST``
is assumed.

The template in ``templates/form_template.pt`` might look something
like this:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <html>
   <head><title>My page</title></head>
   <body>
     <span tal:replace="request.form()"/>
   </body>
   </html>

A callable which renders the HTML for the form will be provided as the
``request.form`` attribute within the template.

Actions
-------

An *action* is a subdirective of the ``formish:form`` directive.  It
names a *handler*, a *param*, and a *title*.  For example:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <formish:form
     for=".models.MyModel"
     name="add_community.html"
     renderer="templates/form_template.pt"
     controller=".forms.AddCommunityController">

     <formish:action
       name="submit"
       title="Submit"
       />

     <formish:action
       name="cancel"
       title="Cancel"
       validate="false"
       />

   </formish:form>

Any number of ``formish:action`` tags can be present within a
``formish:form`` tag.

Each ``formish:action`` tag represents a submit button at the bottom
of a rendered form that will be given an HTML "value" matching the
``name`` attribute.  When this button is pressed, the value of
``name`` will be present in the ``request.params`` dictionary.  The
*value* of the button (the text visible to the user) will be the value
of the ``title`` attribute.

The ``name`` attribute of an action tag also represents the name of a
*handler* for an action.  Handlers are defined on form controller
classes as a method of the form controller class named
``handle_<actionname>``.  A handler method is invoked only when the
value of the ``param`` attribute for its action is present as a key in
the ``request.params`` dictionary *and* when the submission validates
properly (or when ``validate="false"`` is present in the action
definition).

Form Controllers
----------------

A *form controller* is a Python class which has the following
responsibilities:

- Provide the *default values* for the form's fields.

- Provide the *fields* used by the form.

- Provide the *widgets* used to render the form's fields.

- Provide a *display method* for the form.

- Provide one or more *handlers* for the form's actions that are
  invoked by :mod:`pyramid_formish` after succesful validation.

A form controller may also (but commonly does not) provide a method
that does custom validation of a form submission.

Each responsibility of a form controller is fulfilled by a *method* of
the form controller.  This is of course not the only way to factor
this particular problem (for example, it would have been possible to
have a single method responsible for both returning fields and
widgets), but the division seems to be the "least worst" way to factor
the problem.  The division makes the form controller testable; in
particular, the only *conditions* in form controller methods are pure
business logic conditions, not "framework meta" conditions (such as
"is this a POST request?").

Form Controller Constructor
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The constructor of a form controller class should accept two arguments:
``context`` and ``request``.  The ``context`` is the :mod:`pyramid` context
of the view which creates the form controller, and the ``request`` is the
WebOb request object.  For example:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from my.package import security

   class AddCommunityFormController(object):
       def __init__(self, context, request):
           self.context = context
           self.request = request
           self.workflow = security.get_workflow(context)

The constructor for a form controller is called whenever a request that
displays or validates a form is handled.  Like a :mod:`pyramid` view, a form
controller's lifecycle is no longer than the lifecycle of a single
:mod:`pyramid` request.

The imports and associated APIs defined in the examples above and
below are fictional, but for purposes of example, we'll assume that
the ``my.package.security`` module offers an API which allows the
developer to determine whether a "workflow" is available for the
current context representing a dynamic set of choices based on the
current state of the context; furthermore it offers an API to see if
there are any valid security transitions for the current user
associated with this workflow.  This sort of thing is typical in a
content management system.  Although it is purely fictional, this
example hopefully demonstrates that we can influence both the form and
the schema as necessary based on a set of conditions in the handler's
initialization.

Providing Field Default Values
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The form controller provides *default values* to a Formish form via
its ``form_defaults`` method.  The ``form_defaults`` method of a form
controller accepts no arguments, and should return a dictionary
mapping a form field name to a Python value.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from my.package import security

   class AddCommunityFormController(object):
       def __init__(self, context, request):
           self.context = context
           self.request = request
           self.workflow = security.get_workflow(context)

       def form_defaults(self):
           defaults = {
           'title':'',
           'tags': [], 
           'description':'',
           'text':'',
           }
           if self.workflow is not None:
               defaults['security_state']  = self.workflow.initial_state
           return defaults

If a form controller does not provide the ``form_defaults`` method, no
defaults are associated with the rendered form.

Providing Fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A form controller provides Formish with the *fields* of a form via its
``form_fields`` method.  If defined, it must return a sequence of
two-tuples.  Each tuple in the returned value should be of a certain
composition: the first value in the tuple should be a string
containing the field name, the second value should a a
``schemaish.Structure`` object representing a data type.  The first
value in the tuple should match the name supplied as a dictionary key
in the ``form_defaults`` method.  The second value in the tuple should
be a ``schemaish`` Structure object, such as a ``schemish.String`` or
another data type.  These types of objects often make use of
:term:`validatish` validators.  For example:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from my.package import security
   import schemaish
   from validatish import validator

   tags_field = schemaish.Sequence(schemaish.String())

   description_field = schemaish.String(
       description=('This description will appear in search results and '
                    'on the community listing page.  Please limit your '
                    'description to 100 words or less'),
       validator=validator.All(validator.Length(max=500),
                                       validator.Required())
       )

   text_field =  schemaish.String(
       description=('This text will appear on the Overview page for this '
                    'community.  You can use this to describe the '
                    'community or to make a special announcement.'))

   security_field = schemaish.String(
       description=('Items marked as private can only be seen by '
                    'members of this community.'))

   class AddCommunityFormController(object):
       def __init__(self, context, request):
           self.context = context
           self.request = request
           self.workflow = security.get_workflow(context)

       def form_fields(self):
           fields = [
              ('title', title_field),
              ('tags', tags_field),
              ('description', description_field),
              ('text', text_field),
              ]
           if self.workflow is not None and self.workflow.states:
               fields.append(('security_state', security_field))
           return fields

The structure returned by ``form_fields`` is the ordered set of data
types of fields associated with a form, as well as any validation
constraints for individual fields on the form.  Note that the actual
field objects it returns don't need to be reconstructed on every
request; they can be shared between requests, as in the above example.

A result of ``form_fields`` does not describe the user interface
elements associated with the fields it describes (this is the job of
*widgets*).

If a form controller does not supply a ``form_fields`` method, an
error is raised.

THe ``schemaish`` package allows you to define a set of fields in a
*schema*, which is spelled as a Python class definition with
class-level attributes as named structure objects.  This spelling is
not directly supported by :mod:`pyramid_formish`, largely
because it doesn't match the idea of conditional fields very well.

Providing Widgets
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Widgets are associated with fields via the ``form_widgets`` method of
a form controller.  The ``form_widgets`` method accepts a list of
fields (this is really just the return value of the ``form_fields``
method of your form controller), and should return a dictionary.  Each
of the keys in the dictionary should be a field name, and the value
should be a Formish widget.  For example:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from my.package import security
   from my.package import widgets

   import formish

   class AddCommunityFormController(object):
       def __init__(self, context, request):
           self.context = context
           self.request = request
           self.workflow = security.get_workflow(context)

       def form_widgets(self, fields):
           widgets = {
             'title':formish.Input(),
             'description': formish.TextArea(cols=60, rows=10),
             'text':widgets.RichTextWidget(),
             }
           widgets['tags'] = widgets.TagsAddWidget()
           schema = dict(fields)
           if 'security_state' in schema:
               security_states = self.workflow.states
               widgets['security_state'] = formish.RadioChoice(
                   options=[ (s['name'], s['title']) for s in security_states],
                   none_option=None)
           return widgets

If the form controller does not supply a ``form_widgets`` method, the
default Formish widgets for the schema's field types are used.  These
are defined by the Formish package itself.

Providing a Display Method
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The *display method* of a form controller is its ``__call__`` method.
The ``__call__`` method accepts no arguments.  It must return either a
dictionary or a WebOb *response* object.  If the display method
returns a dictionary, the *renderer* associated with the form
controller's ZCML ``renderer`` attribute (typically a template) will
be used to render the dictionary to a response.  Here's an example of
a form controller with a display method on it.

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from my.package import security
   from my.package import api

   class AddCommunityFormController(object):
       def __init__(self, context, request):
           self.context = context
           self.request = request
           self.workflow = security.get_workflow(context)

       def __call__(self):
           api = api.TemplateAPI(self.context, self.request)
           return {'api':api, 'page_title':'Edit %s' % self.context.title}

If there is no key in in ``request.params`` dictionary which matches
the ``param`` value of a particular ``formish:action`` associated with
a form, the ``__call__`` of the controller is called and the form is
displayed.  Likewise, if a form is submitted, and validation fails,
the ``__call__`` of the controller is called and the form is
redisplayed with errors.

For example, if the form we're defining above is invoked with a
request that has a params dict that has the value ``cancel`` as a key,
the ``handle_cancel`` method of the ``.forms.AddCommunityController``
handler will be called after validation is performed.  But if neither
``submit`` nor ``cancel`` is present in ``request.params``, the
``__call__`` method of the controller is called, and no validation is
performed.

If a form controller does not supply a ``__call__`` method, an error
is raised at form controller display time.

Providing Handlers
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Each *handler* of a form controller is responsible for returning a
response or a dictionary.  A *handler* of a form controller is called
after *validation* is performed successfully for an *action*.  Note
that these handlers are *not* called when form validation is
unsuccessful: when form validation is not successful the form display
method is called and the form is redisplayed with error messages.

Each handler has the method name ``handle_<action_name>``.  If the
``validate`` flag of a ``formish:action`` tag is ``true`` (the
default), the associated handler will accept a single argument named
``converted``.  If the ``validate`` tag is false, it will accept no
arguments.

For example, the ``cancel`` action of a ``formish:form`` ZCML
definition for a form controller (which is defined in ZCML as
``validate="false"`` might be defined as so:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from webob.exc import HTTPFound
   from pyramid.traversal import model_url

   class AddCommunityFormController(object):
       def __init__(self, context, request):
           self.context = context
           self.request = request
           self.workflow = security.get_workflow(context)

       def handle_cancel(self):
           return HTTPFound(location=model_url(self.context, self.request))

A more complex example, which provides the ``submit`` action for the
form we've been fleshing out so far is as follows (it is
``validate=true`` by default, so accepts a ``converted`` argument):

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from webob.exc import HTTPFound
   from pyramid.security import authenticated_userid
   from pyramid.traversal import model_url

   from repoze.lemonade.content import create_content
   from my.package.interfaces import ICommunity

   class AddCommunityFormController(object):
       def __init__(self, context, request):
           self.context = context
           self.request = request
           self.workflow = security.get_workflow(context)

       def handle_submit(self, converted):
           request = self.request
           context = self.context
           userid = authenticated_userid(request)
           community = create_content(ICommunity,
                                      converted['title'],
                                      converted['description'],
                                      converted['text'],
                                      userid,
                                      )
           # required to use moderators_group_name and
           # members_group_name
           community.__name__ = converted['title']
           community.tags = converted['tags']
           context[name] = community

           if self.workflow is not None:
               if 'security_state' in converted:
                   self.workflow.transition_to_state(community, request,
                                                    converted['security_state'])
           location = model_url(community, request,
                                'members', 'add_existing.html',
                                query={'status_message':'Community added'})
           return HTTPFound(location=location)

The return value of the above example's handler is a "response" object
(an object which has the attributes ``app_iter``, ``headerlist`` and
``status``).  A handler is permitted to return a response or a
dictionary.  If it returns a dictionary, the ``template`` associated
with the form is rendered with the result of the dictionary in its
global namespace.

If a ``handle_<actionname>`` method for a form action does not exist
on a form controller as necessary, an error is raised at form
submission time.

A handler may also raise a ``pyramid_formish.ValidationError``
exception if it detects a post-validation error.  This permits
"whole-form" validation that requires data that may only be known by
the handler at runtime.  When a handler raises such an error, the form
is rerendered with the error present in the rendering.  The error
should be raised with keyword arguments matching field names that map
to error messages, e.g.:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

   from pyramid_formish import ValidationError
   raise ValidationError(title='Wrong!')

A Fully Composed Form Controller

Here's a fully composed form controller:

.. code-block:: python
   :linenos:

                    'on the community listing page.  Please limit your '
                    'description to 100 words or less'),
       validator=validator.All(validator.Length(max=500),
                                       validator.Required())
       )

           widgets['tags'] = widgets.TagsAddWidget()
           schema = dict(fields)
           if 'security_state' in schema:
               security_states = self.workflow.states
               widgets['security_state'] = formish.RadioChoice(
                   options=[ (s['name'], s['title']) for s in security_states],

Using Multiple Forms Per Page
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can render multiple forms per page by using the
``<formish:forms>`` ZCML tag to surround a set of ``<formish:form>``
ZCML tags.  For example:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <formish:forms
     view=".views.multiforms_view"
     for=".models.MyModel"
     renderer="templates/forms_template.pt"
     name="add_community.html">

     <formish:form
       controller=".forms.AddCommunityController"
       form_id="add_community">

       <formish:action
         name="submit"
         title="Submit"
         />

       <formish:action
         name="cancel"
         title="Cancel"
         validate="false"
         />

     </formish:form>

     <formish:form
       controller=".forms.AddCommentController"
       form_id="add_comment">

       <formish:action
         name="submit"
         title="Submit"
         />

       <formish:action
         name="cancel"
         title="Cancel"
         validate="false"
         />

     </formish:form>

   </formish:forms>

Assuming the below template is used as
``templates/forms_template.pt``:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <html>
   <head><title>My page</title></head>
   <body>
     <span tal:repeat="form request.forms" tal:replace="form()"/>
   </body>
   </html>

And assuming the remainder of the dotted names in the above
configuration can be resolved, the resulting page will contain two
forms.  The appropriate handler will be called upon a submission of
either.

In this mode, the ``<formish:form>`` tags accept only two attributes:
``controller`` and ``form_id``.  Both are required, and the
``form_id`` attribute should be unique for each form within a forms
group.  These attributes have the same meaning as when they are used
in a non-multiform context.

The remainder of the arguments that are normally associated with the
``<formish:form>`` tag when the non-multiform mode is used (such as
``for_``, ``name``, ``renderer``, ``permission``, ``containment``,
``route_name``, and ``wrapper``) must be placed on the
``<formish:forms>`` tag instead.

Along with the attributes that normally belong to the
``<formish:form>`` tag, the ``<formish:forms>`` tag also accepts a
``view`` argument.  This argument should be a dotted name to a
:mod:`pyramid` view function or class that is willing to render a
template that renders all the forms in the sequence of forms implied
by the ``<formish:forms>`` directive.  These forms will be available
as a sequence named ``request.forms`` as this template is rendered;
each can be called to render a single form, e.g.:

.. code-block:: xml
   :linenos:

   <html>
   <head><title>My page</title></head>
   <body>
     <span tal:repeat="form request.forms" tal:replace="form()"/>
   </body>
   </html>

Note that because there are multiple forms to render, the same
template cannot currently be used to render multiple forms as is used
to render a single form (the single-form template expects
``request.form``, but a multiform view template will expect
``request.forms``).

The ``__call__`` method ("display method") of a form controller that
is part of a ``forms`` group is never invoked.  Instead, the callable
named by the ``view`` attribute attached to the ``forms`` tag is used
as a display method.

The ``action`` subtag of ``<formish:form>`` tags in this mode operate
the same way as they do when multiple forms are not involved.

Converting a :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` Application to :mod:`pyramid_formish`
----------------------------------------------------------------------------

Prior iterations of :mod:`pyramid_formish` were released as a package named
:mod:`repoze.bfg.formish`.  :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` users are encouraged to
upgrade their deployments to :mod:`pyramid_formish`, as, after the first
final release of :mod:`pyramid_formish`, further feature development on
:mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` will cease.

Most existing :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` applications can be converted to a
:mod:`pyramid_formish` application in a mostly automated fashion.  Here's how
to convert a :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` application to a
:mod:`pyramid_formish` application:

#. Ensure that your application works under :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` version
   0.3 or better.  If your application has an automated test suite, run it
   while your application is using :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` 0.3+.
   Otherwise, test it manually.  It is only safe to proceed to the next step
   once your application works under :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` 0.3+.

   If your application has a proper set of dependencies, and a standard
   automated test suite, you might test your :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish`
   application against :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` 0.3 like so:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ bfgenv/bin/python setup.py test

   ``bfgenv`` above will be the virtualenv into which you've installed
   :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` 0.3.

#. Install :mod:`pyramid_formish` into a *separate* virtualenv as per the
   instructions in the Pyramid installation documentation.  The
   :mod:`pyramid_formish` virtualenv should be separate from the one you've
   used to install :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish`.  A quick way to do this:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd ~
      $ virtualenv --no-site-packages pyramidenv
      $ cd pyramidenv
      $ bin/easy_install pyramid_formish

#. Put a *copy* of your :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` application into a temporary
   location (perhaps by checking a fresh copy of the application out
   of a version control repository).  For example:

   .. code-block:: bash

      $ cd /tmp
      $ svn co http://my.server/my/bfg/application/trunk bfgapp

#. Use the ``bfgformish2pyramidformish`` script present in the ``bin``
   directory of the :mod:`pyramid_formish` virtualenv to convert all
   :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` Python import statements into compatible
   :mod:`pyramid_formish` import statements. ``bfg2pyramid`` will also fix
   ZCML directive usages of common :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` directives. You
   invoke ``bfg2pyramid`` by passing it the *path* of the copy of your
   application.  The path passed should contain a "setup.py" file,
   representing your :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` application's setup script.
   ``bfgformish2pyramidformish`` will change the copy of the application *in
   place*.

   .. code-block:: bash
 
      $ ~/pyramidenv/bfgformish2pyramidformish /tmp/bfgapp

   ``bfgformish2pyramidformish`` will convert the following
   :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` application aspects to :mod:`pyramid_formish`
   compatible analogues:

   - Python ``import`` statements naming :mod:`repoze.bfg.formish` APIs will
     be converted to :mod:`pyramid_formish` compatible ``import`` statements.
     Every Python file beneath the top-level path will be visited and
     converted recursively, except Python files which live in
     directories which start with a ``.`` (dot).

   - Each ZCML file found (recursively) within the path will have the default
     ``xmlns:formish`` attribute attached to the ``configure`` tag changed
     from ``http://namespaces.repoze.org/formish`` to
     ``http://pylonshq.com/pyramid_formish``.  Every ZCML file beneath the
     top-level path (files ending with ``.zcml``) will be visited and
     converted recursively, except ZCML files which live in directories which
     start with a ``.`` (dot).

   - ZCML files which contain directives that have attributes which name a
     ``repoze.bfg.formish`` API module or attribute of an API module will be
     converted to :mod:`pyramid_formish` compatible ZCML attributes.  Every
     ZCML file beneath the top-level path (files ending with ``.zcml``) will
     be visited and converted recursively, except ZCML files which live in
     directories which start with a ``.`` (dot).

#. Edit the ``setup.py`` file of the application you've just converted (if
   you've been using the example paths, this will be
   ``/tmp/bfgapp/setup.py``) to depend on the ``pyramid_formish``
   distribution instead the of ``repoze.bfg.formish`` distribution in its
   ``install_requires`` list.  The original may look like this:

   .. code-block:: text

     requires = ['repoze.bfg.formish', ... other dependencies ...]

   Edit the ``setup.py`` so it has:

   .. code-block:: text

     requires = ['pyramid_formish', ... other dependencies ...]

   All other install-requires and tests-requires dependencies save for the
   one on ``repoze.bfg.formish`` can remain the same.

#. Retest your application using :mod:`pyramid_formish`.  This might be as
   easy as:

   .. code-block:: bash

     $ cd /tmp/bfgapp
     $ ~/pyramidenv/bin/python setup.py test

#. Fix any test failures.

#. Start using the converted version of your application.  Celebrate.
